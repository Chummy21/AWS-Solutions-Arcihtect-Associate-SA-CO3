#Python Programming (05/04/2023)
##(Day 1)  print("coding is wow") 

(Day 2) three skills learned (print, input, variables)
The input command-----------------------input("What's your name?:")
yourName = input("What's your name?:")
yourFavoritefood = input("What's your favourite food?:")
yourFavoritemusic = input("What's your favourite music?:")
yourCountry = input("Where do you live?:")
print()
print("You are?:")
print("Chioma")
print("You are probably hungry for Burritos")
print("And you are definitely getting your groove")
print("Sugarcane by Camidoh")
print("Living in the amazing")
print("California")

(Day3)Learn about concatenating (Concatenation is the ability to glue or join together bits or string of text and variables together to make a good output.
myName = input("What's your name? ")
myLunch = input("What are you having for lunch? ")
print(myName, "is going to be chowing down on", myLunch, "very soon!")

number = input("Give me a number: ")
group = input("Give me a collective noun for a group of things: ")
thing = input("Give me the name of a weird or wacky thing: ")
print("No I don't think that", number, "is a", group, "of", thing,". That's just odd.")

foodName = input("Name a food: ")
plantName = input("Name a type of plant: ")
myCooking = input("Name a method of cooking: ")
word = input("What word describes burned food?:")
diy = input("Name a DIY item:")
print(myCooking, foodName, "with", word, plantName, "on a bed of", diy)

print("SECURE LOGIN")
username = input("Username > ")
password = input("Password > ")
if username == "mark" and password == "password":
   print("Welcome Mark!")
elif username == "suzanne" and password == "Su74nne":
   print("Hey there Suzanne!")
else:  
   print("Go away!")

(Day4)Learned how to use the variable, input and also how to write a story and project and color it using concatenation.

print("Welcome to your Adventure Simulator")
print("I am going to ask you a bunch of questions and then create an epic story with you as the star") 
print()
yourName = input("What is your name?: ")
worstenemysName = input("What is your worst enemy's name?: ")
yourSuperpower = input("What is superpower?: ")
yourFavouritefood = input("What is your favourite food?: ")
print()
print("The story of my tech journey began last year when I lost a job because of lack of experience in cloud computing.")
print()
print("Last year, I started my journey in tech to learn all about the cloud and my nickname is", yourName)
print("\033[1;32m Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet and my worst enemy is", worstenemysName, "I have a superpower which is\033[34m", yourSuperpower, "\033[31m and I love eating", yourFavouritefood)

(Day5) Today, I learned about the "If Statements" and "Else Statement".....If something is true, then do this specific block of code. Double equals (==) is asking the computer to compare if these two things are exactly the same
If the condition is not met with the if statement, then we want the computer to do the else part instead. Likewise, if the condition is met in the if statement, then the else bit is ignored by the computer. The else statement must be the first thing unindented after the if statement and in line with it

myName = input("What's your name?: ")
if myName == "David":
   print("Welcome Dude!") 
   print("You're just the baldest dude I've ever seen")
else:
   print("Who on earth are you?!")
   
   print("Chioma likes going to the movies")
print()
print("Lets answer these questions")
print()

hangingAround = input("Does Chioma like 'hanging around'?: ")
if hangingAround == "No":
    print("Chioma is not a spider-man")

gravellyVoice = input("Does Chioma have a 'gravelly' voice?: ")
if gravellyVoice == "No":
    print("Aww, then Chioma is not a chorester")

feelMarvelous = input("Does Chioma often feel 'Marvelous'?: ")
if feelMarvelous == "No":
    print("Wow")
else:
    print("Aha! You're Captain Chioma!!! Hello!")
    
###(Day 6) Today, I learned, the elif command (which stands for 'elseif'). This allows you to ask 2, 3, 4 or 142 questions using the same input! This command must be in a certain place. You can have as many elif statements as you want, but they must go in between if and else and have the same indentation. The print statements in your elif command need to line up with the indent of the other print statements.

print("SECURE LOGIN")
username = input("Username > ")
if username == "mark":
   print("Welcome Mark!")
elif username == "suzanne":
   print("Hey there Suzanne!")
else:  
   print("Go away!")
   
I wrote a program where someone logsin with their username and password and gets a lovely individual greeting using (if, elif and else commands)

print("A program where someone logs-in with their username and password and gets a lovely individaul greeting.")
print()
username = input("What is your name?")
password = input("What is your password?")

if username == "Chioma" and password == "beauty" :
  print("Chioma is a beautiful Lady!")
elif username  == "Chisom" and password == "charming" :
  print("Chisom is a pretty Woman!")
elif username == "Chizzy" and password == "adorable" :
  print("Chizzy is an adorable programmer!")
else:
  print("You are not authorized. See the admin!")
  
###(Day 7) Today, I learned about nesting. Nesting is where we put an if statement within an if statement using the power of indenting. The second if statement within the first if statement must be indented and its print statement needs to be indented one more time

tvShow = input("What is your favourite tv show?")
if tvShow == "Moneyline with Nancy" :
  print("Ugh, why?")
  faveCharacter = input("Who is your favourite character?")
  if faveCharacter == "Nancy" :
    print("Right answer")
  else:
    print("Nancy is the greatest.")
elif tvShow == "Super story" :
  print("Aww, happy times")
else:
  print("Yeah, that's cool and all")

order = input("What would you like to order: pizza of hamburger?")
if order == "hamburger" :
  print("Thank you")
  cheese = input("Do you want cheese?")
  if cheese == "yes" :
    print("You got it")
  else:
    print("No cheese it is.")
elif order == "pizza" :
  print("pizza coming up")
  toppings = input("Do you want pepperoni on that?")
  if toppings == "yes" :
   print("We will add pepperoni.")
else:
  print("Yeah, that's cool and all")

###(Day8) I built a "Customized Affirmation Generator" using all the skills I have learned (Input and Output, Concatenation, IF statements, and Nested IF  statements)! 

print("My daily custom affirmation generator.")
print()

name = input("What is your name?")
if name == "Chioma" or name == "chioma":
  print("Welcome to a new week")
week = input("What is the day of the week?")
if week == "Monday" or week == "monday":
  print("My monday will be a success!")
if week == "Tuesday" or week == "tuesday":
  print("Tuesday all the way!")
if week == "Wednesday" or week == "wednesday":
  print("Wednesday, way to go!!!")
if week == "Thursday" or week == "thursday":
  print("I am blessed this thursday")
if week == "Friday" or week == "friday":
  print("Thank God its friday")

elif name == "Chioma" or name == "chioma":
  week = input("What is the day of the week?")
  if week == "monday" or week == "Monday":
    print(name,"It's a beautiful day!")
    if week == "tuesday" or week == "Tuesday":
     print("Awesome tuesday",name)
    if week == "wednesday" or week == "Wednesday":
     print("Women crush wednesday")
    if week == "thursday" or week == "Thursday":
     print("I am succesful!!", name)
    if week == "friday" or week == "Friday":
     print(name,"Cheers to the freaking weekend🥰🥰")
else:
  print(name,"Your name is so lovely. Have a blessed day!")
    
###(Day9)..Today, I learned about casting. The 'If statement' does not support only ==, it also supports mathematical signs
Casting is where we explicitly tell the computer that what we are typing is a number and not a letter.

myScore = int(input("Your score: "))
if myScore > 10000:
  print("Winner!")
else:
  print("Try again later!")
  
Also learned about integers and float
 goodGirl = int(input("what is the addition of 3 and 5? : "))
if goodGirl == 8 :
  print("correct")
else:
  print("wrong")     
      
myPi = float(input("what is pi to 3dp? : "))
if myPi == 3.142 :
  print("correct")
else:
  print("wrong")      

print("Generation Identifier")
print()
birthYear = int(input("Which year were you born?"))
if birthYear <= 1925:
  print("Hello, Baby boomers, keep glowing!")
elif birthYear >= 1947 and birthYear <= 1964:
  print("Gen X, how far?")
elif birthYear >= 1982 and birthYear <= 19995:
  print("Welcome Millenials!")
elif birthYear >= 2015:
  print("Gen z")
else:
  print("Not available!")

####(Day10) Today, I tried different mathematical symbols
adding = 4 + 3
print(adding)
print()

subtraction = 8 - 9
print(subtraction)
print()

multiplication = 4 * 32
print(multiplication)
print()

division = 50 / 5
print(division)
print()

# a number raised to a power of something is **
squared = 5**2
print(squared)
print()

# the remainder of a division
modulo = 15 % 4
print(modulo)
print()

# whole number division
divisor = 15 // 2
print(divisor)

#multiplication
multiplication = 3.4 * 6.8
print(multiplication)
print()

#division
division = 2467 /4673
print(division)
print()

#raise 10 to the power of 2
squared = 10 ** 2
print(squared)
print()

#print the remainder when 343 is divided by 4
divisor = 343 // 100
print("343 // 100")
print()
print(divisor)

I built a tip calculator
print("Tip calculator")
print()
totalBill = float(input("What was the bill?:"))
numberOfpeople = int(input("How many people?:"))
tippercentage = int(input("tippercentage to leave:"))
billwithtip = (totalBill+(totalBill * tippercentage/100))
totalBill = billwithtip/numberOfpeople
print("You all owe", totalBill)

(Day11)..wrote a program to calculate the seconds in a year
print("Find out - how many seconds are in a year?")
print()
seconds = int(input("How many seconds are in a minute? "))
print()
minutes = int(input("How many minutes are in an hour? "))
print()
hours = int(input("How many hours in a day? "))
print()
days = int(input("How many days in a month? ")) 
print()
month = (input("How many month in a year? "))
print()
leapYear = input("Is it a leap year? ")
print()
secondsinaYear = (seconds*minutes*hours*365)
leapyearinsecs = (seconds*minutes*hours*366)
if secondsinaYear == "yes" or secondsinaYear == "Yes":
  print("There are",secondsinaYear)
if leapYear == "no" or leapYear == "No":
  print("There are",leapyearinsecs,"in a year.")
else:
  print("There are", secondsinaYear,"in a year.")

(Day12) Today, I debugged some gnarly bugs in my codes🐛 . Debugging means identifying and fixing a problem in your codes. 

Given code to debug(Day 12 challenge)
print("100 Days of Code QUIZ")
print()
print("How many can you answer correctly?)
ans1 = ("What language are we writing in?")
if ans1 == "python":
  print("Correct")
else:
  print("Nope🙈
ans2 = input("Which lesson number is this?")
if(ans2>12):
print("We're not quite that far yet")
else:
  print("We've gone well past that!")
elif(ans2==12):
  print("That's right!")
  
 Debugged code
 print("100 Days of Code QUIZ")
print()
print("How many can you answer correctly?")
print()
ans1 = input("What language are we writing in?")  
if ans1 == "python":
  print("Correct")
else:
  print("Nope🙈")
ans2 = int(input("Which lesson number is this?")) 
if "ans2 > 12":
  print("We're not quite that far yet")
elif ans2 == "12":
  print("That's right!")
else:
  print("We've gone well past that!")

(Day13)I built an 'Exam Grade Calculator' today
print("Exam Grade Generator")
print()
examName = input("What is the name of the exam?")
print()   
maximumScore = int(input("What is the maximum score?"))
print()
yourScore = int(input("\033[33m Your score is:"))
print()

totalScore =  float(yourScore/maximumScore)
finalNumber = round(totalScore, 2)
finalPercentage = round(totalScore*100, 2)
print("You got", finalPercentage,"%")

if finalNumber >= .90:
  print("\033[31m Congratulations, your grade is an A+")
elif finalNumber >= .80 and finalNumber <= .89:
  print("Your grade is an A-.")
elif finalNumber >= .70 and finalNumber <= .79:
  print("Welldone,Your grade is a B.")
elif finalNumber >= .60 and finalNumber <= .69: 
   print("Your grade is a C and its cool.")
elif finalNumber >= .50 and finalNumber <= .59:
  print("Your grade is a D. You need to study harder.")
elif finalNumber <= .49:
  print("Your grade is an F")
else:
  ("Go and rewrite your exam!")

(Day14) I built my first multiplayer game using the input, if, else, and elif statements 🪨 📄✂️!!!
print("EPIC 🪨  📄 ✂️ BATTLE")
print()
player1Name = input("player1, what is your name?")
print()
player2Name = input("player2, what is your name?")
from getpass import getpass as input
print("Select your move, R, P or S:")
print()
print(player1Name, "your time is up")
player1Name = input("Pick your move >")
print()
print(player2Name, "oya pick your move!")
player2Name = input("Pick your move >")
print()
if player1Name == "r" or player1Name == "R":
  if player2Name == "r" or player2Name == "R":
    print("You both picked Rock, so its a draw!")
  elif player2Name == "p" or player2Name == "P":
    print(player2Name, "win")
  elif player2Name == "s" or player2Name == "S":
    print(playerName1, "Warning")
  else:
    print("That's invalid!")
if player1Name == "p" or player1Name == "P":  
  if player2Name == "r" or player2Name == "R":
    print(player1Name, "win")
  elif player2Name == "p" or player2Name == "P":
    print("its a draw")
  elif player2Name == "s" or player2Name == "S":
    print(player2Name, "win")
else:
  print("That's invalid!")
if player1Name == "s" or player1Name == "S":
  if player2Name == "r" or player2Name == "R":
    print(player2Name, "win")
