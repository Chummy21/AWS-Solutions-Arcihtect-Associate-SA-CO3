Python Programming (05/04/2023)
(Day 1)  print("coding is wow")  

(Day 2) three skills learned (print, input, variables)
The input command-----------------------input("What's your name?:")
yourName = input("What's your name?:")
yourFavoritefood = input("What's your favourite food?:")
yourFavoritemusic = input("What's your favourite music?:")
yourCountry = input("Where do you live?:")
print()
print("You are?:")
print("Chioma")
print("You are probably hungry for Burritos")
print("And you are definitely getting your groove")
print("Sugarcane by Camidoh")
print("Living in the amazing")
print("California")

(Day3)Learn about concatenating (Concatenation is the ability to glue or join together bits or string of text and variables together to make a good output.
myName = input("What's your name? ")
myLunch = input("What are you having for lunch? ")
print(myName, "is going to be chowing down on", myLunch, "very soon!")

number = input("Give me a number: ")
group = input("Give me a collective noun for a group of things: ")
thing = input("Give me the name of a weird or wacky thing: ")
print("No I don't think that", number, "is a", group, "of", thing,". That's just odd.")

foodName = input("Name a food: ")
plantName = input("Name a type of plant: ")
myCooking = input("Name a method of cooking: ")
word = input("What word describes burned food?:")
diy = input("Name a DIY item:")
print(myCooking, foodName, "with", word, plantName, "on a bed of", diy)



print("SECURE LOGIN")
username = input("Username > ")
password = input("Password > ")
if username == "mark" and password == "password":
   print("Welcome Mark!")
elif username == "suzanne" and password == "Su74nne":
   print("Hey there Suzanne!")
else:  
   print("Go away!")

(Day4)Learned how to use the variable, input and also how to write a story and project and color it using concatenation.

print("Welcome to your Adventure Simulator")
print("I am going to ask you a bunch of questions and then create an epic story with you as the star") 
print()
yourName = input("What is your name?: ")
worstenemysName = input("What is your worst enemy's name?: ")
yourSuperpower = input("What is superpower?: ")
yourFavouritefood = input("What is your favourite food?: ")
print()
print("The story of my tech journey began last year when I lost a job because of lack of experience in cloud computing.")
print()
print("Last year, I started my journey in tech to learn all about the cloud and my nickname is", yourName)
print("\033[1;32m Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet and my worst enemy is", worstenemysName, "I have a superpower which is\033[34m", yourSuperpower, "\033[31m and I love eating", yourFavouritefood)

(Day5) Today, I learned about the "If Statements" and "Else Statement".....If something is true, then do this specific block of code. Double equals (==) is asking the computer to compare if these two things are exactly the same
If the condition is not met with the if statement, then we want the computer to do the else part instead. Likewise, if the condition is met in the if statement, then the else bit is ignored by the computer. The else statement must be the first thing unindented after the if statement and in line with it

myName = input("What's your name?: ")
if myName == "David":
   print("Welcome Dude!") 
   print("You're just the baldest dude I've ever seen")
else:
   print("Who on earth are you?!")
   
   print("Chioma likes going to the movies")
print()
print("Lets answer these questions")
print()

hangingAround = input("Does Chioma like 'hanging around'?: ")
if hangingAround == "No":
    print("Chioma is not a spider-man")

gravellyVoice = input("Does Chioma have a 'gravelly' voice?: ")
if gravellyVoice == "No":
    print("Aww, then Chioma is not a chorester")

feelMarvelous = input("Does Chioma often feel 'Marvelous'?: ")
if feelMarvelous == "No":
    print("Wow")
else:
    print("Aha! You're Captain Chioma!!! Hello!")
    
(Day 6) Today, I learned, the elif command (which stands for 'elseif'). This allows you to ask 2, 3, 4 or 142 questions using the same input! This command must be in a certain place. You can have as many elif statements as you want, but they must go in between if and else and have the same indentation. The print statements in your elif command need to line up with the indent of the other print statements.

print("SECURE LOGIN")
username = input("Username > ")
if username == "mark":
   print("Welcome Mark!")
elif username == "suzanne":
   print("Hey there Suzanne!")
else:  
   print("Go away!")
   
I wrote a program where someone logsin with their username and password and gets a lovely individual greeting using (if, elif and else commands)

print("A program where someone logs-in with their username and password and gets a lovely individaul greeting.")
print()
username = input("What is your name?")
password = input("What is your password?")

if username == "Chioma" and password == "beauty" :
  print("Chioma is a beautiful Lady!")
elif username  == "Chisom" and password == "charming" :
  print("Chisom is a pretty Woman!")
elif username == "Chizzy" and password == "adorable" :
  print("Chizzy is an adorable programmer!")
else:
  print("You are not authorized. See the admin!")
