Python Programming (05/04/2023)
(Day 1)  print("coding is wow")  

(Day 2) three skills learned (print, input, variables)
The input command-----------------------input("What's your name?:")
yourName = input("What's your name?:")
yourFavoritefood = input("What's your favourite food?:")
yourFavoritemusic = input("What's your favourite music?:")
yourCountry = input("Where do you live?:")
print()
print("You are?:")
print("Chioma")
print("You are probably hungry for Burritos")
print("And you are definitely getting your groove")
print("Sugarcane by Camidoh")
print("Living in the amazing")
print("California")

(Day3)Learn about concatenating (Concatenation is the ability to glue or join together bits or string of text and variables together to make a good output.
myName = input("What's your name? ")
myLunch = input("What are you having for lunch? ")
print(myName, "is going to be chowing down on", myLunch, "very soon!")

number = input("Give me a number: ")
group = input("Give me a collective noun for a group of things: ")
thing = input("Give me the name of a weird or wacky thing: ")
print("No I don't think that", number, "is a", group, "of", thing,". That's just odd.")

foodName = input("Name a food: ")
plantName = input("Name a type of plant: ")
myCooking = input("Name a method of cooking: ")
word = input("What word describes burned food?:")
diy = input("Name a DIY item:")
print(myCooking, foodName, "with", word, plantName, "on a bed of", diy)

(Day4)Learned how to use the variable, input and also how to write a story and project and color it using concatenation.

print("Welcome to your Adventure Simulator")
print("I am going to ask you a bunch of questions and then create an epic story with you as the star") 
print()
yourName = input("What is your name?: ")
worstenemysName = input("What is your worst enemy's name?: ")
yourSuperpower = input("What is superpower?: ")
yourFavouritefood = input("What is your favourite food?: ")
print()
print("The story of my tech journey began last year when I lost a job because of lack of experience in cloud computing.")
print()
print("Last year, I started my journey in tech to learn all about the cloud and my nickname is", yourName)
print("\033[1;32m Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet and my worst enemy is", worstenemysName, "I have a superpower which is\033[34m", yourSuperpower, "\033[31m and I love eating", yourFavouritefood)
