(Day 2) three skills learned (print, input, variables)
The input command-----------------------input("What's your name?:")
yourName = input("What's your name?:")
yourFavoritefood = input("What's your favourite food?:")

(Day3)Learn about concatenating (Concatenation is the ability to glue or join together bits or string of text and variables together to make a good output.
myName = input("What's your name? ")
myLunch = input("What are you having for lunch? ")
print(myName, "is going to be chowing down on", myLunch, "very soon!")

number = input("Give me a number: ")
group = input("Give me a collective noun for a group of things: ")
thing = input("Give me the name of a weird or wacky thing: ")
print("No I don't think that", number, "is a", group, "of", thing,". That's just odd.")
